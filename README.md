# photon angled light

TODO: 
- Set timeout on all modes
- github push from vscode
- Alexa
- More fun modes: white light dropping, rotating around colors, throbbing
- Publish mode changes to UI? Would this need React?

DONE:
- Move to materialize
- figure out how to build on netlify
- test out defaults and disabled or slow wifi
- party speed
